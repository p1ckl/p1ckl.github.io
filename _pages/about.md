I am an undergraduate computer science student at University of Houston. I mainly work on research, and my current project is trying to find efficient ways to compute continual reinforcement learning models. My current advisor is [Dr. Sen Lin](https://slin70.github.io). My older project is about trying to predict student performance by clustering them based on their learning styles using K-Means-Clustering. I was working under [Dr. Nouhad Rizk](https://uh.edu/nouhadrizk/)
